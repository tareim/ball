Project Title:  ball
Description of Project This was an MIT exercise where a ball moved around the space from our code. We might add more CSS later but it was simple for now. The ball can move across the screen and others can be added to complete the game.

How to Run: Each part of the code copied together will help run this ball game . Running each piece at a time may help as it is put together and revisiting the code and related resources can fix errors

Roadmap of future improvements: We are hoping to add more styling
